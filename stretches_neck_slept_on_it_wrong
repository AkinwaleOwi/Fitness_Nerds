dc: fitness + stretches + neck = ? fsn.0? 
====================
Here are gentle, effective neck stretches to relieve stiffness or a “slept-on-it-wrong” kink. These are safe for most people as long as you move slowly and stop if anything hurts sharply.
================================

🔹 1. Upper Trapezius Stretch

How to do it:

Sit or stand tall.

Tilt your head to one side (ear toward shoulder).

Optional: Gently use the same-side hand to add light pressure.

Hold 20–30 seconds, switch sides.

Helps with: Side-of-neck tightness.

========================================
2. Levator Scapulae Stretch

How to do it:

Turn your head 45° toward one armpit.

Gently pull your head down toward that armpit.

Hold 20–30 seconds, switch sides.

Helps with: That “can’t turn my head” pain after sleeping.
==================================
🔹 3. Sternocleidomastoid (SCM) Stretch

How to do it:

Sit tall.

Tilt your head back slightly and away from the tight side.

You should feel a stretch in the front/side of your neck.

Hold 20–30 seconds, switch sides.

Helps with: Front-of-neck tension and limited rotation.
======================================
4. Chin Tucks (for alignment)

How to do it:

Sit tall with shoulders relaxed.

Gently draw your chin straight back (like a double chin).

Hold 5 seconds, repeat 10–15 times.

Helps with: Stiffness at the base of your skull; resets posture.
============================================

🔹 5. Gentle Neck Rotations

How to do it:

Slowly turn your head left and right.

Stay within a pain-free range.

10 repetitions each direction.

Helps with: Warm-up and restoring mobility.
============================================
Bonus: Shoulder Rolls

(Neck pain often comes from tension in shoulders.)

Roll shoulders up → back → down 10 times, then reverse.
============================================
When to be cautious

Stop or ease up if you feel:

Sharp or shooting pain

Numbness or tingling down the arm

Headache that gets worse

If symptoms last more than 2–3 days, heat plus gentle movement usually helps; persistent severe pain may warrant a physical therapist.
