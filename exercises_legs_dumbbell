0. Quads prime

Top Dumbbell Quad-Focused Exercises
1. Dumbbell Front Squat

Hold one or two dumbbells at your shoulders.

Keep torso upright as you squat.

Why it works: Front loading shifts emphasis to the quads.

2. Dumbbell Goblet Squat

Hold a single dumbbell vertically at your chest.

Squat deep with knees tracking over toes.

Very quad-dominant, especially with upright posture.

3. Dumbbell Bulgarian Split Squat

Rear foot elevated behind you.

Hold dumbbells at your sides.

Big quad stimulus, especially with a small forward lean.

4. Dumbbell Reverse Lunge

Step backward and keep front shin upright.

Push through the ball of the front foot.

Reverse lunges hit the quads more than forward lunges for many people.

5. Dumbbell Step-Ups

Step onto a bench or box while holding dumbbells.

Use a knee-dominant push (don’t overly hinge forward).

Higher steps increase quad involvement.

6. Dumbbell Walking Lunges

Long, controlled strides.

Slight knee-over-toe is okay and increases quad demand.

7. Dumbbell Heel-Elevated Squat

Elevate heels on small plates or a wedge while holding dumbbells.

Forces a more upright torso and deeper knee bend → max quad activation.

8. Dumbbell Sissy Squat (Assisted)

Hold a dumbbell at chest or sides.

Lean back while allowing knees to travel forward.

One of the most quad-isolating movements you can do.

9. Dumbbell Hack Squat (Heel-Elevated)

Dumbbells held behind your legs.

Squat down while letting knees travel forward.

Mimics a machine hack squat → extremely quad-focused.

💡 Tips to Maximize Quad Activation

Allow knees to travel forward.

Keep torso upright.

Elevate heels if needed.

Focus on deep knee flexion.

Keep tension through the mid-foot and forefoot.

1. Hamstrings prime

Top Dumbbell Hamstring-Focused Exercises
1. Dumbbell Romanian Deadlift (RDL)

Slight bend in the knees.

Push hips back while keeping spine neutral.

Most effective dumbbell exercise for hamstrings.

2. Dumbbell Stiff-Leg Deadlift

Less knee bend than an RDL.

Increases stretch on the hamstrings.

Great for deep hamstring lengthening.

3. Dumbbell Good Morning (Dumbbells on Shoulders)

Hold dumbbells at your shoulders.

Hinge hips back.

Very hamstring-dominant, similar to barbell version.

4. Dumbbell Single-Leg RDL

One dumbbell or two.

Improves balance, glute–ham stability, and strength.

Excellent unilateral hamstring work.

5. Dumbbell Glute Bridge / Dumbbell Hip Thrust

Place dumbbell on hips.

Drive hips up while keeping shins vertical.

Hits the upper hamstrings + glutes.

6. Dumbbell Hamstring Slide (with Towels or Sliders)

Lie on your back, heels on towels on a smooth floor.

Hold a dumbbell on your pelvis for load.

Extend legs out and curl them back in → hamstring curl pattern.

7. Dumbbell Leg Curl (Between Feet)

Lie face down or seated.

Hold a dumbbell between your feet and curl it up.

Surprisingly effective if done carefully.

8. Dumbbell Step-Back Lunge (Hamstring-Biased)

Big backward step.

Keep forward shin vertical.

Focus on hip hinge as you descend → more hamstring engagement.

9. Dumbbell 45° Back Extension (with Dumbbell Hug)

If you have a back extension bench.

Hug a dumbbell and hinge over the pad.

Strong hamstring/hip hinge emphasis.

💡 Tips to Maximize Hamstring Activation

Focus on hip hinge movements (hips back, slight knee bend).

Think stretch–load–contract: long hamstring stretch → controlled lift.

Move slowly through the eccentric (downward phase).

If you want, I can create a:
✅ Hamstring-only dumbbell workout
or
✅ Balanced leg day (quads + hamstrings)

Just tell me what you prefer!
