Oof, stiff upper-mid back is the worst. Let’s loosen that thoracic spine without overdoing it. Try these—slow breaths, no forcing it. 🧘‍♂️

### 🌬️ Gentle + effective stretches

**1. Cat–Cow**

* On hands and knees.
* Inhale: drop the belly, lift chest (cow).
* Exhale: round your upper back, push the floor away (cat).
* 6–10 slow rounds.

**2. Thread the Needle**

* From hands and knees, slide one arm under your chest, palm up.
* Let your shoulder and upper back melt toward the floor.
* Hold 20–40 sec each side.

**3. Seated Upper-Back Stretch**

* Sit or stand, clasp hands in front of you.
* Push hands forward, round the upper back, tuck chin slightly.
* Breathe into the stretch for 30 sec.

**4. Thoracic Extension Over Chair**

* Sit with feet planted, hands behind head.
* Lean back over the top of a chair or couch edge.
* Keep ribs down, extend from upper back.
* 6–8 slow reps.

**5. Child’s Pose (with side stretch)**

* Knees down, hips to heels, arms long.
* Walk hands slightly to the right → stretch left upper back.
* Switch sides. Hold 30–60 sec.

### 🔄 Mobility bonus (feels amazing)

**Open Books**

* Lie on your side, knees bent.
* Arms straight out, palms together.
* Open top arm across your body, rotating chest toward the ceiling.
* 6–10 reps each side.

### 🧠 Pro tips

* Breathe **into the stiff spot**—upper ribs expanding.
* Heat beforehand helps a lot (warm shower or heating pad).
* If it’s sharp pain, tingling, or getting worse → stop.

If you want, tell me:

* desk job vs workouts?
* one spot or whole upper back?
* stiff in the morning or after sitting?

I can dial these in perfectly for you.
